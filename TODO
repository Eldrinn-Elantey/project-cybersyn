bugs:
	request threshold is being bypassed somehow (hasn't been seen in a long time)

major:
	do hardcore testing
	models & art
	add a modding interface (the moment someone asks for this I will make sure it's in the next update)

minor:
	railloader compat
	close gui when the combinator is destroyed
	do not play close sound when a different gui is opened
	gui can desync if settings are changed outside of it while it is open
