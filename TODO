bugs:
	request threshold is being bypassed somehow
	wagon control combinators don't work parallel to the tracks

major:
	do hardcore testing
	models & art

minor:
	railloader compat
	close gui when the combinator is destroyed
	do not play close sound when a different gui is opened
	gui can desync if settings are changed outside of it while it is open
	go over init and make it agree with type info
