bugs:
	request threshold is being bypassed somehow (hasn't been seen in a long time)

major:
	models & art
	move to an event based algorithm
	debug output
	more detailed missing train alerts

minor:
	railloader compat
	close gui when the combinator is destroyed
	do not play close sound when a different gui is opened
	gui can desync if settings are changed outside of it while it is open
	give the combinators a sensible reaction to low or no power
