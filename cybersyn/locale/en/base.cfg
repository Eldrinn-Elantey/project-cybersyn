cybersyn-ticks-per-second=Dispatcher updates per second

[mod-setting-description]
cybersyn-ticks-per-second=How many times per second the dispather should check for new deliveries. Deliveries are made one at a time per update. This value will be rounded up to a divisor of 60.
cybersyn-request-threshold=The default request threshold when a request threshold signal is not given to a station. Huge values will prevent stations from taking requests from the network unless an explicit threshold is set.
cybersyn-provide-threshold=The default provide threshold when a provide threshold signal is not given to a station. Huge values will prevent stations from providing to the network unless an explicit threshold is set.
cybersyn-network-flag=The default set of networks a station will service when no network signal is given to a station. This integer is interpretted bit-wise to give 32 possible network flags to choose from.

[item-name]
cybersyn-combinator=Cybernetic combinator

[item-description]
cybersyn-combinator=Place next to a train stop to add it to the cybersyn train network. This stop can now request or provide items using the circuit network. Be sure to set a threshold signal.

[entity-name]
cybersyn-combinator=Cybernetic combinator
cybersyn-combinator-output=Cybernetic combinator output

[entity-description]
cybersyn-combinator=Has 4 different operation modes. Primary control allows providing and requesting. Optional Control allows setting thresholds per-item and reading all in progress deliveries. Depot control allows parked trains to be added to the network. Wagon control allows for reading the desired contents of the adjacent wagon.
