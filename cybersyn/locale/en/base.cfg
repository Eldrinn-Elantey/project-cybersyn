cybersyn-ticks-per-second=Dispatcher updates per second
cybersyn-request-threshold=Default requester threshold
cybersyn-network-flag=Default network flags
cybersyn-warmup-time=Station warmup time

[mod-setting-description]
cybersyn-ticks-per-second=How many times per second the dispather should check for new deliveries. Deliveries are made one at a time per update. This value will be rounded up to a divisor of 60.
cybersyn-request-threshold=The default request threshold when a request threshold signal is not given to a station. Huge values will prevent stations from taking requests from the network unless an explicit threshold is set.
cybersyn-network-flag=The default set of networks a station will service when no network signal is given to a station. This integer is interpretted bit-wise to give 32 possible network flags to choose from.
cybersyn-warmup-time=How many seconds a cybernetic combinator will wait before connecting to the Cybersyn network. A grace period to modify or correct the circuit network before trains start dispatching to a newly blueprinted station.

[item-name]
cybersyn-combinator=Cybernetic combinator

[item-description]
cybersyn-combinator=Place next to a train stop to add it to the Cybersyn train network. This stop can now request or provide items that are reported to it by the circuit network.

[entity-name]
cybersyn-combinator=Cybernetic combinator
cybersyn-combinator-output=Cybernetic combinator output

[entity-description]
cybersyn-combinator=Has 4 different operation modes. Primary control allows providing and requesting. Optional Control allows setting thresholds per-item and reading all in progress deliveries. Depot control allows parked trains to be added to the network. Wagon control allows for reading the desired contents of the adjacent wagon.
cybersyn-combinator-output=¡Viva la Revolución!

cybersyn-train-network=Cybernetic train network

[technology-description]
cybersyn-train-network=Train stop controllers capable of coordinating the inputs and outputs of an entire economy.

[virtual-signal-name]
cybersyn-priority=Station priority
cybersyn-request-threshold=Request threshold
cybersyn-locked-slots=Locked slots per cargo wagon

[cybersyn-messages]
missing-trains=No trains available to make a delivery from __2__ to __1__
lost-train=A train has become lost
nonempty-train=A train has parked in a depot while still containing items; it cannot be dispatched until it is empty

operation=Mode
comb1=Primary station control
comb2=Optional station control
depot=Depot control
wagon-manifest=Wagon control
network=Network
network-tooltip=A signal is used to identify which network this combinator is a member of. Trains will only be dispatched from depots to provide and request stations if they are all identified with the same signal.
auto-tooltip=When checked trains in the network are automatically blacklisted if they are not able to interact with all of the loading and unloading machines present along the station. When unchecked the blacklist is empty and all trains are allowed.
auto-description=Automatic train blacklist
switch-provide=Provide only
switch-request=Request only
switch-provide-tooltip=Lock this station to only provide items to the network. By default it both requests and provides.
switch-request-tooltip=Lock this station to only request items from the network. By default it both requests and provides.
