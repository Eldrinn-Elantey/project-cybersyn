[mod-setting-description]
cybersyn-ticks-per-second=How many times per second the central planner should update the state of the network and schedule deliveries. Only one deliveries can be made per update. This value will be rounded up to a divisor of 60.
cybersyn-wait-time=How many seconds the duration of a train's inactivity order will be set to. Trains will be forced to wait in the station or depot until this amount of time has passed without the train receiving any kind of interaction. Non-zero values prevent inserters from getting stuck and prevent trains from leaving depots without refueling. Decimal values are allowed, they will be rounded up to a multiple of 1/60 (0.01667).
cybersyn-request-threshold=The default request threshold when a request threshold signal is not given to a station. When a station receives a negative item signal that surpasses its request threshold, so long as any station exists with a positive signal greater than the request threshold, a delivery of that item will be scheduled between the two stations.
cybersyn-network-flag=The default set of sub-networks a station will service when no network signal is given to a station. This integer is interpretted bit-wise to give 32 possible sub-network flags to choose from.
cybersyn-warmup-time=How many seconds a cybernetic combinator will wait before connecting to the Cybersyn network. This is a grace period to modify or correct the circuit network before trains start dispatching to a newly blueprinted station.
cybersyn-stuck-train-time=After this many seconds from a train's dispatch, an alert will be sent to let you know a train is probably stuck and has not completed its delivery. The player will likely have to debug their network to get the train unstuck.

[item-name]
cybersyn-combinator=Cybernetic combinator

[item-description]
cybersyn-combinator=Place next to a train stop to add it to the Cybersyn train network. This stop can now request or provide items that are reported to it by the circuit network.

[entity-name]
cybersyn-combinator=Cybernetic combinator
cybersyn-combinator-output=Cybernetic combinator output

[entity-description]
cybersyn-combinator=Has 4 different operation modes. Primary control allows providing and requesting. Optional Control allows setting thresholds per-item and reading all in progress deliveries. Depot control allows parked trains to be added to the network. Wagon control allows for reading the desired contents of the adjacent wagon.
cybersyn-combinator-output=¡Viva la Revolución!

cybersyn-train-network=Cybernetic train network

[technology-description]
cybersyn-train-network=Train stop controllers capable of coordinating the inputs and outputs of an entire economy.

[virtual-signal-name]
cybersyn-priority=Station priority
cybersyn-request-threshold=Request threshold
cybersyn-locked-slots=Locked slots per cargo wagon

[cybersyn-messages]
missing-trains=No trains available to make a delivery from __2__ to __1__
lost-train=A train from depot __1__ has become lost
nonempty-train=A train is being held in the depot because it still has cargo
unexpected-train=A train has unexpectedly returned to the depot before completing its delivery
stuck-train=A train from depot __1__ is stuck

operation=Mode
comb1=Primary station control
comb2=Optional station control
depot=Depot control
wagon-manifest=Wagon control
network=Network
network-tooltip=A signal is used to identify which network this combinator is a member of. Trains will only be dispatched from depots to provide and request stations if they are all identified with the same signal.
auto-tooltip=When checked trains in the network are automatically blacklisted if they are not able to interact with all of the loading and unloading machines present along the station. When unchecked the blacklist is empty and all trains are allowed.
auto-description=Automatic train blacklist
switch-provide=Provide only
switch-request=Request only
switch-provide-tooltip=Lock this station to only provide items to the network. By default it both requests and provides.
switch-request-tooltip=Lock this station to only request items from the network. By default it both requests and provides.
